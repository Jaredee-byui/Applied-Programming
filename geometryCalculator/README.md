# Overview

So, it had been awhile since I had last written any code using classes. I had also been meaning to get my 
feet wet with C++. As such, I decided to remake an app I had written in C for a geometry calculator.
Little did I know, this would ballon into a rather large project. It did get finished though. 

The geometry calculator, it's a rather simple program. The user interfaces with the program via a simple
menu I drafted up. The user can navigate through the menu to several sub-menus that handle different
shapes. The user can then find the area and perimeter by entering the required information. The info
for the shape is stored to an object which can then be accessed by the user while in that sub-menu. 

As mentioned earlier, my primary goal with creating this project was to get myself some practice in
object orientated programming useing C++.

# Development Environment

The program was developed using Visual Studio. 

C++ was the development language for this pet project, the math.h library was also used.
